# Web Debugging and Optimization Exercise

## Overview

This exercise is designed to improve your skills in web debugging and optimization. You will be working with an intentionally flawed web application. Your task is to identify and document the problems in the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Instructions

Copy this README.md into your Devtools REPO in a new MD file called Day-5.md

### Step 1: Identify Problems

Go through the provided files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`). Each file contains several marked problems (indicated by comments like `<!-- Problem 1: -->`, `/* Problem 5: */`, etc.). Your task is to identify what each problem is and why it is an issue.

### Step 2: Document Each Problem

In this README.md file, document each problem. Write a sentence for each problem explaining what the issue is and why it's problematic. Use the format below for your documentation:

#### Problem 1:

- Description: [Your explanation here]

#### Problem 2:

- Description: [Your explanation here]

[Continue with the remaining problems]

### Step 3: Propose Solutions

For each identified problem, propose a solution or an optimization strategy. Briefly describe how you would fix the issue.

#### Problem 1:

-the style link began with <link>, it needs to begin with <style> Document is also missing title; Added Profile as title

### Problem 2:

### Problem 3:

#### Problem 5:

-there are two font types, I removed arial

### Problem 6:

-Nothing is defined to color.  The code would work better if it looked like this: body { background-color: #0000ff; }

### Problem 7:

<!-- -img#largeImage {
  width: 1200px; 
  height: auto;
} -->
This whole code looks wrong. 

  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800">
  this is how it should look

 #### Problem 8:

 <!-- - body div#profileContainer > h2 {
  font-size: 2em;
}  -->
This makes no sense to me at all.  I don't know what to do with it.

### Problem 9:
### Problem 10:
### Problem 11:

### Step 4: Reflect

This has been the most difficult assignment for me this week.  I am not sure I correctly solved more then 3, if that many.  

## Submission

Submit this README.md file with all the problems documented and solved, along with your reflection. Ensure that your explanations are clear and concise.

This exercise is an opportunity to practice critical web development skills. Pay close attention to detail and think about how each issue affects the overall performance and user experience of the web application.
