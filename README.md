In the index.html, the script was in the head so I moved it to the bottom of the body.  There is also a script for app.js but there is no file so I commented it out.

// Error 1: Message is misspelled in the console command

Error 3: changed "Button Clicked" to "click" moved console.log out of curly brackets
